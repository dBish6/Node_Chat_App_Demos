Socket.io Back-end

v2.3.2
minor:
- typing socket added.
- join_room socket removed and now there is a manage_room socket for both join and leave messages.
- CustomError class and errorHandler for HTTP.
patch:
- Proper error handling implemented for sockets.
- DTO types are actually named as a DTO type.

v3.4.4
major:
- Huge refactor; separates concerns by a api folder and a sockets folder.
minor:
- userJoined track added.
patch:
- The room schemas now use the user id as the _id.
- Collection name added to the chat schemas because it kept pluralizing the names; chat_alpha to chat_alphas (not cool).

v3.4.5
patch:
- userJoined track fixed.

v3.5.10
minor:
- Adds Rollup for the production build. Docker and fly config also added for hosting the server on fly.io.
patch:
- Circular dependency fix.
- user vars/fields/keys replaced with username.
- Leave message fix (supposed to be a object like the joined message).
- Sockets chatService manageRoom method wasn't supposed to be getting the userList on leave fix.
- Storing of the userList fix; every user wasn't seeing the same list because it was a instance of the class.
