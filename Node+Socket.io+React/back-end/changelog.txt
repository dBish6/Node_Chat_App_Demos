Socket.io Back-end

v2.3.2
minor:
- typing socket added.
- join_room socket removed and now there is a manage_room socket for both join and leave messages.
- CustomError class and errorHandler for HTTP.
patch:
- Proper error handling implemented for sockets.
- DTO types are actually named as a DTO type.

v3.4.4
major:
- huge refactor; separates concerns by a api folder and a sockets folder.
minor:
- userJoined track added.
patch:
- the room schemas now use the user id as the _id.
- Collection name added to the chat schemas because it kept pluralizing the names; chat_alpha to chat_alphas (not cool).
