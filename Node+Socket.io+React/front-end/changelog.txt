v3.11.34
patch:
- The overlayLoader is now responsive.
- emitLeaveUserList removed.
- apiUrl changed for production.
- The return () => socket.disconnect() on app unmount is now removed since web sockets do that by default.

v3.11.36
patch:
- Proper path manipulation for github pages in the html files and adds a 404.html.
- favicon images added.

v3.11.42
patch:
- The leave room message now shows on page leave; refresh, etc.
- RoomHandlers.js is not needed anymore and deleted.
- The roomId is now persisted in sessionStorage and other corresponding changes.
- At the Home page, the room buttons doesn't emit the join in emitManageRoom anymore because you can refresh the chat now, emitManageRoom is onLoad.
- The loading state for the chat is better; now actually waits for the 'setup' using Promise.all and then the loading is 'complete' when random avatars are added to the initial users.
- The OverlayLoader isn't really a overlay loader anymore because since we can refresh the chat now, socket.io isn't connected when refreshed. So, it now renders the loader and then renders the content after.

v3.11.43
patch:
- Empty chat room message fix because of the loading changes.
